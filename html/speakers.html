                    <h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
                    <p>
                        Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t
                        end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and
                        the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design
                        to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
                        embraces design and allows it to succeed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get*
                        design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have
                        that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture.
                        Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself
                        anywhere else.

                    <h5>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h5>
                    <p>
                        Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of
                        well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put
                        this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to
                        focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together
                        comprise a well-told story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the
                        technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as
                        cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we
                        might look to them for inspiration.

                    <p>
                        Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration,
                        communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam
                        combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in
                        computer science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and
                        services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies
                        a story; uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives

                    <h5>(YOU SHOULD BE) TESTING YOUR JAVASCRIPT</h5>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS,
                        Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This talk
                        will share tips on how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to remove buggy
                        code through testing.
